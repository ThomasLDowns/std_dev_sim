# std_dev_sim
Simulation of standard seviation calculations

Based on description of an experiment from http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/QQ/database/QQ.09.99/freeman2.html.
Designed to show the reasoning behind dividing by (n-1) when calculating the standard deviation of a sample from a population,
rather than dividing by n.
